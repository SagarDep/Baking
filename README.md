## Project Overview

You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

## Why this Project?

As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.

## What Will I Learn?

In this project you will:

* Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
* Handle error cases in Android.
* Add a widget to your app experience.
* Leverage a third-party library in your app.
* Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.

## App Description

Your task is to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacity’s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

[The recipe listing is located here](http://go.udacity.com/android-baking-app-json).

The JSON file contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos and images you will need to complete this project. Don’t assume that all steps of the recipe have a video. Some may have a video, an image, or no visual media at all.

One of the skills you will demonstrate in this project is how to handle unexpected input in your data -- professional developers often cannot expect polished JSON data when building an app.

## Rubric

### General App Usage
- [x] App should display recipes from provided network resource.
- [x] App should allow navigation between individual recipes and recipe steps.
- [x] App uses RecyclerView and can handle recipe steps that include videos or images.
- [x] App conforms to common standards found in the [Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines](http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html).

### Components and Libraries
- [x] Application uses Master Detail Flow to display recipe steps and navigation between them.
- [x] Application uses Exoplayer to display videos.
- [x] Application properly initializes and releases video assets when appropriate.
- [x] Application should properly retrieve media assets from the provided network links. It should properly handle network requests.
- [x] Application makes use of Espresso to test aspects of the UI.
- [x] Application sensibly utilizes a third-party library to enhance the app's features. That could be helper library to interface with Content Providers if you choose to store the recipes, a UI binding library to avoid writing findViewById a bunch of times, or something similar.

### Homescreen Widget
- [x] Application has a companion homescreen widget.
- [x] Widget displays ingredient list for desired recipe.
